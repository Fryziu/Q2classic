### Sound Quality System

This fork introduces a tiered sound quality system, controlled by the `s_quality` cvar. This allows players to choose between the authentic classic sound and a progressively enhanced audio experience with modern features. Each level builds upon the previous one.

You can change the quality level at any time via the console (e.g., `s_quality 0`, `s_quality 1`, etc.).

#### `s_quality 0`: Classic Mode
*   **Description:** The original, untouched Quake II sound experience. This mode is for purists who want the game to sound exactly as it did in 1997.
*   **Attenuation:** Uses the original **linear** volume falloff model. Sounds fade out uniformly with distance.
*   **Spatialization:** Provides horizontal (left/right) positioning only.

#### `s_quality 1`: Enhanced Attenuation
*   **Description:** Introduces a more realistic and nuanced sound falloff model.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Logarithmic Attenuation:** Replaces the linear model with a more natural logarithmic (inverse-square) curve. Sounds are louder up close and fade more gently over long distances, improving spatial awareness.

#### `s_quality 2`: Enhanced Positional Audio
*   **Description:** Adds vertical (Z-axis) positioning to the soundscape.
*   **Features:**
    *   Includes all enhancements from Level 1.
    *   **Vertical Volume Panning:** Sounds originating significantly above or below the player are slightly attenuated (reduced in volume), providing a basic sense of verticality.

#### `s_quality 3`: Highest Quality (Positional Filtering)
*   **Description:** The most immersive and realistic audio setting, simulating how the human ear perceives sound from different elevations.
*   **Features:**
    *   Includes all enhancements from Level 2.
    *   **Dynamic Low-Pass Filter:** Sounds originating above or below the player are not just quieter but also muffled (high frequencies are cut). This provides a strong, intuitive audio cue for vertical positioning, making it easier to pinpoint enemies on different floors.

*This tiered sound system was designed and implemented in collaboration with the GPT-4 model from OpenAI.*
